# Smart-Pay-FaceCard
This was an assessment project to develop a smart pay card whereby the user's card info such as country of origin, currency, name, cards expiry date etc would be validated before the payment is made. Here, you really needed to roll up your sleeves and code like a pro. It was tough and thought provoking but I finished the project in the end having learnt a lot of Javascript.
